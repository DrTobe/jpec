{"name":"Jpec","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\njpec is a minimalistic JPEG encoder written in C with a focus on **simplicity**.\r\n\r\nIt is both **portable** (tested on x86 and ARM) and **lightweight** (around 600 LOC).\r\n\r\nThe library has no external dependencies.\r\n\r\nIt is a perfect candidate if you have some embedded C code you need to extend with a JPEG encoder the easy way, e.g. it is currently used in production within the [Moodstocks SDK](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-sdk) (as of release v3.1) to compress frames that are sent to [Moodstocks API](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-api) search service.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, feel free to read this [blog post](http://www.moodstocks.com/2012/02/10/jpec-the-whys-and-the-hows/).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThe library allows you to write JPEG compressed images from input image data on memory. No more, no less.\r\n\r\nMore precisely:\r\n\r\n* it works in **grayscale only** (monochrome JPEG file): there is no support for color so far,\r\n* it produces baseline, DCT-based (SOF0), JFIF 1.01 (APP0) JPEG-s,\r\n* it supports **8x8 blocks only**,\r\n* it includes default quantization and Huffman tables that are not customizable at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nJust type:\r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\nThis produces:\r\n\r\n* `libjpec.a`: the static library,\r\n* `jpec`: a simple command-line tool used to test the library (see `main.c`)\r\n\r\n> **NOTE** the command-line tool depends on OpenCV HighGUI module to easily read any kind of input image. You need to have OpenCV development libraries installed on your machine to use it (e.g. `brew install opencv` on Mac OS X with Homebrew).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you want to embed the library into your own C code you are free to create the static library file, and include `jpec.h` main header, or to copy-paste the whole code into your project.\r\n\r\nThen, encoding a raw image is a matter of a few lines of code:\r\n\r\n        /* Create a JPEG encoder provided image data */\r\n        jpec_enc_t *e = jpec_enc_new(img, w, h);\r\n\r\n        /* Compress */\r\n        int len;\r\n        const uint8_t *jpeg = jpec_enc_run(e, &len);\r\n\r\n        /* Do something with the JPEG blob (e.g. save into a file, etc) */\r\n\r\n        /* Release the encoder */\r\n        jpec_enc_del(e);\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n[Maxime Brénon](https://github.com/mbrenon) & [Cédric Deltheil](http://about.me/deltheil).\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Moodstocks SAS\r\n","tagline":"A lightweight and portable JPEG encoder written in C.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
